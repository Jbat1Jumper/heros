# heros

This is a Rust implementation of the Hero Realms game. As today, the project is
still a work in progress and may change it's name _a la_
[_TEG_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten%C3%A9s_Empanadas_Graciela). The main
goal of this project is technical exploration in the following topics:

- Event sourcing for game architecture
- Game replay analysis
- Frontend agnostic API
- Game AI 
- Decentralized game servers
- Web UI using Rust and wasm
